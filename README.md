## Get started

You can start by reading the small [wiki](https://github.com/paologaleotti/blaze/wiki) with examples.

To scaffold a new blaze project, simply run this command:

```bash
go run github.com/paologaleotti/blaze-cli@master
```

This will use the [blaze-cli](https://github.com/paologaleotti/blaze-cli) to scaffold the project. You can also use the GitHub template or simply clone the repo.
